ðŸ’¡ Hint
From Arrow Functions to Classic Functions: Remember that older JavaScript versions do not recognize arrow functions (=>). Use the traditional function keyword to declare functions instead.

Manual Property Access: Since object destructuring is a more recent feature, you'll need to revert to accessing object properties the old-fashioned way. Use dot notation or bracket notation to get values from objects.

Default Parameters Workaround: To emulate this behavior, check if function parameters are undefined within the function body and manually assign them default values if necessary.

Object Copying without Spread: To combine objects or copy them, initiate a new object and loop through properties of the source object(s), copying each property explicitly.
